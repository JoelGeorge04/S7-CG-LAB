# Computer Graphics

## About
A collection of **computer graphics programs** implemented using **Python**, with **OpenGL** and **Pygame** where applicable. This repository demonstrates fundamental graphics algorithms and techniques, including:

- **Line Drawing** (DDA, Bresenham)
- **Circle and Curve Generation** (Midpoint Circle, Bezier curves)
- **2D Transformations** (Translation, Rotation, Scaling, Reflection, Shearing)
- **Clipping Algorithms** (Line and Polygon Clipping)
- **Image Enhancement Techniques** (Contrast Stretching, Histogram Equalization, Sharpening)

This collection is designed for learning and experimentation in computer graphics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.7) and then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL matplotlib numpy
